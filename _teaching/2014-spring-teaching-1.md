The course is all about basic artificial intelligence and machine learning knowledge. Students develop applications in tasks such as problem solving, data mining, game playing, natural language understanding, and robotics. As a peer mentor, I held 7 office hours per week and actively answered piazza questions. During my OH, I would instruct students to finish their programming homework and provides tips when they need.
