About Me
======
Welcome! I am Xingpeng Sun, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aniket Bera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=q3UdHk4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) with Distinctive Scholastic Achievement.


My research interest is in foundation model, robotics, and graphics. I am eager to work on the intersection of large language model (LLM) + robotics & graphics, focus on advancing the capabilities and safety of autonomous systems through enhanced natural language understanding and decision-making processes. I also work on text-guided trajectory generation and 3D assets editing.

<b style="color: red;">I am actively seeking research internship opportunities in LLM/VLM, Embodied AI, and AIGC for summer 2025. If you know of any exciting opportunities or just want to chat about potential collaborations, feel free to drop me an email.</b>

Miscellaneous
------
I like to watch soccer games, and also travelling. I wrote a [course guide](https://xingpengs.github.io/) about all courses that I've taken at UW-Madison. My girlfriend is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry at Purdue University. Her research focuses on the specialized field of Mass Spectrometry Imaging.
