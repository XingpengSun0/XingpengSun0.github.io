About Me
======
Welcome! I am Xingpeng Sun, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Aniket Bera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=q3UdHk4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) with Distinctive Scholastic Achievement. 

My research interest is in foundation model, robotics, and graphics. I am eager to work on the intersection of large language model (LLM) + robotics, focus on advancing the capabilities and safety of autonomous systems through enhanced natural language understanding and decision-making processes. I also work on foundation model + graphics projects.

Miscellaneous
------
I like to watch soccer games, and also travelling. I wrote a [course guide](https://xingpengs.github.io/) about all courses that I've taken at UW-Madison. My girlfriend is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Chemistry at Purdue University, which is renowned for ranking No.1 in Analytical Chemistry in the United States. Her research focuses on the specialized field of Mass Spectrometry Imaging.
